## Usage

### Interactive Map

- **Click on a Country** - Opens the Country Conflicts Modal showing historical and current conflicts
- **Click on an Event Marker** - Shows event details popup
- **Click on a Military Base** - Shows base name, type (US/NATO), and country
- **Zoom/Pan** - Navigate the map or use auto-pan mode

### Event Feed

The event feed displays real-time global events. You can:
- Filter by threat level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Filter by category (Conflict, Protest, Disaster, Diplomatic, etc.)
- Search events by keyword
- Click on events to fly to their location on the map

### Auto-Pan Mode

The play/pause button in the bottom-left corner toggles automatic map panning:
- **Play** - Map continuously pans eastward across the globe
- **Pause** - Stops the auto-pan animation

### Entity Search

Search for any organization, country, or group to get:
- Overview and description
- Location markers on the map (headquarters, offices, operations)
- Deep research analysis (optional)
- Related data sources

### Country Conflicts

Click any country on the map to view:
- **Current Tab** (Red) - Active conflicts, military tensions, and ongoing security threats
- **Historical Tab** (Blue) - Past wars and military engagements with dates and outcomes
- **Sources** - Cited references for all conflict information (Wikipedia excluded)

### Alerts

Create alert rules based on:
- Keywords (e.g., "nuclear", "sanctions")
- Threat levels
- Geographic regions (coming soon)

## API Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/events` | GET | Fetch global events from Valyu |
| `/api/events` | POST | Fetch events with custom queries |
| `/api/entities` | GET/POST | Research entities and get locations |
| `/api/reports` | POST | Generate deep research reports |
| `/api/countries/conflicts` | GET | Get historical and current conflicts for a country |
| `/api/military-bases` | GET | Get US and NATO military base locations (1hr cache) |

## Valyu Integration

This app uses [Valyu](https://valyu.ai) for intelligence data:

- **Search API** - Finding global events and news
- **Answer API** - Synthesizing conflict intelligence and military base data
- **Deep Research** - Comprehensive entity analysis

All Valyu queries exclude Wikipedia to ensure higher-quality source citations.

## Authentication

Global Threat Map supports two app modes controlled by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE` environment variable.

### App Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self-hosted` | Default mode. No authentication required. All features are freely accessible. |
| `valyu` | OAuth mode. Users sign in with Valyu to access premium features. |

### Self-Hosted Mode (Default)

In self-hosted mode, the app runs entirely with your own Valyu API key:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=self-hosted
VALYU_API_KEY=your_valyu_api_key_here
```

- No sign-in panel is displayed
- All features are available to all users
- API usage is billed to your Valyu account

### Valyu OAuth Mode

In valyu mode, users authenticate with their Valyu accounts:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=valyu

# OAuth Configuration (contact contact@valyu.ai for credentials)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VALYU_AUTH_URL=https://auth.valyu.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_VALYU_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VALYU_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
VALYU_APP_URL=https://platform.valyu.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/valyu/callback
```

### Feature Gating (Valyu Mode)

When running in valyu mode, certain features require authentication:

| Feature | Unauthenticated | Authenticated |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| View map & events | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| Event feed | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| Country conflicts | ✅ 2 free lookups | ✅ Unlimited |
| Entity search | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Unlimited |
| Military bases | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |

After users exhaust their free usage, a sign-in modal prompts them to authenticate with Valyu. New Valyu accounts receive **$10 in free credits**.

### OAuth Flow

The authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):

1. User clicks "Sign in with Valyu"
2. App generates PKCE code verifier and challenge
3. User is redirected to Valyu's authorization page
4. After authentication, Valyu redirects back to `/auth/valyu/callback`
5. App exchanges authorization code for access token
6. User info is stored in localStorage
